It also presents continuous tensor algebra expressions, such as Cx,y = Ax,y * Bx,y, where indices are defined over a continuous domain. Our implementation supports piecewise-constant tensors, enabling infinite domains to be processed in finite time. We introduce new tensor formats for efficient storage and code generation techniques for automatic kernel generation. For the first time, domains such as computational geometry and computer graphics are expressed in the language of tensor programming. Our compiler demonstrates competitive or better performance compared to hand-optimized kernels across diverse applications, with significant speedups and reduced lines of code in tasks such as radius search, genomic interval queries, and trilinear interpolation in Neural Radiance Fields.",

Symmetric tensors are equal to their transposes, so in the n-dimensional case we can save up to a factor of n! by avoiding redundant operations. Sparse tensors, on the other hand, are mostly zero, and we can save asymptotically by processing only nonzeros. Unfortunately, specializing for both symmetry and sparsity at the same time is uniquely challenging. Optimizing for symmetry requires consideration of n! transpositions of a triangular kernel, which can be complex and error prone. Considering multiple transposed iteration orders and triangular loop bounds also complicates iteration through intricate sparse tensor formats. Additionally, since each combination of symmetry and sparse tensor formats requires a specialized implementation, this leads to a combinatorial number of cases. A compiler is needed, but existing compilers cannot take advantage of both symmetry and sparsity within the same kernel. In this paper, we describe the first compiler which can automatically generate symmetry-aware code for sparse or structured tensor kernels. We introduce a taxonomy for symmetry in tensor kernels, and show how to target each kind of symmetry.

    "abstract": "Predicting the number of clock cycles a processor takes to execute a block of assembly instructions in steady state (the throughput) is important for both compiler designers and performance engineers. Building an analytical model to do so is especially complicated in modern x86-64 Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) machines with sophisticated processor microarchitectures in that it is tedious, error prone, and must be performed from scratch for each processor generation. In this paper we present Ithemal, the first tool which learns to predict the throughput of a set of instructions. Ithemal uses a hierarchical LSTM–based approach to predict throughput based on the opcodes and operands of instructions in a basic block. We show that Ithemal is more accurate than state-of-the-art hand-written tools currently used in compiler backends and static machine code analyzers. In particular, our model has less than half the error of state-of-the-art analytical models (LLVM’s llvm-mca and Intel’s IACA). Ithemal is also able to predict these throughput values just as fast as the aforementioned tools, and is easily ported across a variety of processor microarchitectures with minimal developer effort.",
