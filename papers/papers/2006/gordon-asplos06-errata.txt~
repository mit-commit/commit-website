Errata, corrected in online version:

- Page 5, right column, top paragraph, there was a minor math error.

  ORIGINAL VERSION:
  In the best case ... the speedup is ... 1+\sigma*N.  For example, if
  there are 16 cores and even as little as 1/16th of the work is
  stateful, then pipeline parallelism offers potential gains of 2x.
  For these parameters, the worst-case gain (mu=sigma) is also 2x.
  The best and worst cases diverge for larger values of sigma.

  CORRECT VERSION:
  In the best case ... the speedup is ... 1+sigma*(N-1).  For example,
  if there are 16 cores and even as little as 1/15th of the work is
  stateful, then pipeline parallelism offers potential gains of 2x.
  For these parameters, the worst-case gain (mu=sigma) is 1.8x.  The
  best and worst cases diverge further for larger values of sigma.
